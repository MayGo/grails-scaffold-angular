v1.7.21 - 16/10/2014
Fixed issue the RC release of angular 1.3.0 which was throwing a 'link is undefined' error in the ngModelDecorator.
WARNING: THIS COULD BE A BREAKING CHANGE TO PREVIOUS VERSIONS OF THIS LIBRARY - I have done my best to test but you never know.

v1.6.20 - 12/09/2014
ru-ru language file contributed.  Fixed issue with msg override attribute and double quoting if invalid quote characters are used.

v1.3.20 - 27/08/2014
Fixed issue when submitting a form - the ngSubmit handler ignored the form validation disable attribute disable-dynamic-validation
and validated the form.

v1.2.20 - 26/08/2014
Added the ability to disable the modules validation for a whole form by adding the attribute disable-dynamic-validation
on the form attribute.

v1.1.20 - 20/08/2014
Now following http://semver.org versions.  Added the concept of being able to register a custom form control so that it
is included in the form validation process.  If you have a custom form control that should be validated i.e.
<my-custom-element>...</my-custom-element> it will not be part of the forms HTMLFormControlsCollection and thus won't be
included in the form submission element validation iteration although it will be on the Angular FormController (if it has a name attribute).
So adding the directive register-custom-form-control="" to the control root and autoValidate will include it in the form
(submission) validation process.

Resolve issue with child elements of directives with an isolated scope being validated when they are not user input controls.

v1.0.19 - 14/08/2014

Renamed the debounce service to jcs-debounce as it was conflicting a service with the same name in angular-strap v2.

v1.0.17 - 07/08/2014
Added the ability to disable visual styling of an element in valid and invalid states at an element level.

v1.0.16 - 06/08/2014
Added the ability to override the error message type for an error message type to allow for custom error messages.

v1.0.15 - 02/08/2014
When $setPristine() is called on a ngModel controller this now returns the element to its default visual state.

v1.0.14 - 31/07/2014
Added German culture file contributed by https://github.com/miseeger

v1.0.13 - 28/07/2014
When the form is reset the $setPristine is called on the controls associated ngModel controller to ensure validation isn't fired
again and makes performs validation again.
Added the ability to globally enable/disable valid and invalid element styling.
