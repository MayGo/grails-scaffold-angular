on the form attribute.

v1.1.20 - 20/08/2014
Now following http://semver.org versions.  Added the concept of being able to register a custom form control so that it
is included in the form validation process.  If you have a custom form control that should be validated i.e.
<my-custom-element>...</my-custom-element> it will not be part of the forms HTMLFormControlsCollection and thus won't be
included in the form submission element validation iteration although it will be on the Angular FormController (if it has a name attribute).
So adding the directive register-custom-form-control="" to the control root and autoValidate will include it in the form
(submission) validation process.
